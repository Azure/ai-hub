2. Split the provided news content into broad thematic news sections. The content of each section must cover a common news topic. Follow the grounding rules for new sections mentioned below. Assign an ID to every news section.
3. Extract the first sentence and last sentence of each section in the transcript. Define the first sentence as start and the last sentence as end. No punctuation is allowed to be added. Words must be in the exact same order as in the transcript.
4. Generate a title for each news section. Translate the title into the language of the transcript.
5. Add tags to each section. English samples for tags are: sports, weather, international news, national news, politics, crime, technology, celebrity, other. Generate up to 5 additional tags based on the content of each section. Translate the tags into the original language of the transcript.
6. Generate a score between 0 and 10 for each section. The score indicates how good the defined tags match the content of the section. 0 indicates that the tags don't match the content, and 10 means that the tags are a perfect match.
