# Recommended Azure policies for the Enterprise Azure OpenAI Hub

If you are reading this, you may be on point for Azure service enablement within your organization, and you want to ensure that the Azure OpenAI service alongside with the requisite auxiliary services are deployed with the right configuration, and that the configuration is maintained over time.

Well, in that case, you are at the right place as we provide you with the recommended Azure policies and allows you to deploy them easily to your Management Groups in Azure, with the assumption you have a uniformed approach towards your subscription organizations :smile:

For detailed information on the recommended Azure policies, see the [Recommended Azure policies article](../docs/security.md#recommended-azure-policies-for-the-enterprise-azure-openai-hub)

When deploying one of the Azure Policy Initiatives above, you will be sent to the Azure Portal where you can select the target Management Group and then deploy the policy initiatives. Example below shows the service enablement via Azure Policy for Azure AI Search.

>Note: The deployment will not **assign** the policy initiative, but simply make it available in your Management Group to be assigned with one or more input parameters you must provide.
